# The Games Foxes Play
*"Gaze into my cyan eyes. See an ocean: your identity, a droplet drowned in endless lives."*
A nontraditional traditional roguelike about programming spells and giant snakes.

This game is in active development (started April 2022) and is not in a complete state. I post weekly on [r/roguelikedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/) about my progress in the Sharing Saturday threads. A collection of all these posts can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Oneirical/The-Games-Foxes-Play/tree/main/design/Development%20Logs) & [here](https://github.com/Oneirical/tgfp_rust/tree/main/log%20%26%20ideas)!

## Design Goals

* **All is Soul** - No creatures in the game are hardcoded. Every action is managed by one's Soul, filled to the brim with Axioms dictating each behaviour, each ability and each objective. Careful examination reveals what makes them tick...
* **Hypnotic Sandbox** - As one delves down the complex, the tools to manipulate Souls shall be unveiled, and then, there will be no further limits. Reprogram fearsome foes into self-destruction! Recreate the most devastating spells from the most dangerous of creatures! Link yourself to shoot lasers at every creature on the map through walls on every turn! Accidentally walk into a brainwashing beam and forcibly add yourself to the list of targets! Incinerate yourself with 9 trillion damage! Shrug it off with a spell dictating "when taking damage, heal that amount"!
* **Hypnotic Sandbox** - As one delves down the complex, the tools to manipulate Souls shall be unveiled, and then, there will be no further limits. Reprogram fearsome foes into suicide! Recreate the most devastating spells from the most dangerous of creatures! Link yourself to shoot lasers at every creature on the map through walls on every turn! Accidentally walk into a brainwashing beam and forcibly add yourself to the list of targets! Banish yourself to the space between realities! Effortlessly undo your mistake by swapping your soul back into the body of the foes you were battling!
