*"F"*

* Spawn in the World Seed. Choose a door to reveal a new Room.
* Rooms can contain:
    * Turrets (needs a Crate installed)
    * A simple band of creatures
    * A Cage with one of the main Caste legends
    * A spawner that periodically summons creatures
    * Loot, like Crates
    * Shops/gamble areas
    * 1 Reality Anchor Console
* The objective is to open 3 Cages, get to the Reality Anchor Console and send a signal back in time to authorize Terminal's escape
* The only way to lose is if the Harmony reaches critical mass (total Serene souls > certain number) - at which point it mass converts everything
