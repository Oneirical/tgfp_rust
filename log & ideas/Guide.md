*"F"*

When you spawn in, you'll find yourself in an Assembly Suite. Disregard your roguelike massacre instincts - the creatures here are not your enemy. In fact, your first task will not be to kill, but rather to create.

Don't worry, there will be plenty of opportunities for fighting later on. 

A set of crates will arrive through the Axiom Transport System - an assortment of Forms and Functions. Insert them in their respective sockets on both sides of the room. Each Form-Function pair will dictate one Axiom - a "spell" - obtained by the creature you are assembling. You'll generally want to avoid dangerous or useless combinations, such as "on Self, apply effect Paralyze".

Grab an Ipseity Chassis from the storage area, and push it into the Soul Injector. Stand on the switch on the side to upload all Axioms into the Chassis, and keep moving to start pumping Souls into the Chassis. You'll want enough for it to survive (they are basically its HP, and also make it easier to resist Harmonic taint) but not too much that you drain the funds of the department and find yourself forced to create weaklings in the near future.

Once you step off the switches, the Injector will eject its occupant and transform it into its preset Species, at which point it will come to life! It will casually exit the room, moving to the Contenders' Quarters to prepare for its trial.

Once all Contenders have been fabricated, move over to the Spectator Relay to watch the battle unfold. Winning is good, of course - but it may draw traces of Harmonic taint over to your side. Use the earned Rosids to upgrade.

Snake medics will arrive, turn the soulless into Ipseity Chassis, and return them to your storage.
