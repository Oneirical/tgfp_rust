"Crescent Spear"
- Hits in a circle arc. The length of the arc = how many targets were hit on the last swipe.
Keep the flame burning!

"Glamorous Toxin"
- Basically Death's Door. Does a ton of Ipseity self-damage and gives invincibility for a bit.

"Momentum Exhilaration"
- Moving around restors Inspiration.

Return to the basics. You have a deck of Souls. No need to draw, they constantly get replenished.
Each caste has its own effect. These effects are dictated in the classic way - Form, Function, Mutator.
When your deck is reshuffled, if you have a Serene, it contaminates another in the deck.

Lose in one of the dungeons, and you get to learn new Axioms from the boss (and you physically copy their form, giving a new passive).
Win in one of the dungeons, and you get a fresh batch of Souls, which helps push back the Harmonic taint.

Going full harmonic simply means that from now on, winning harmonizes the level, while losing actually ends your run.

The airlock opens in a hiss of steam.
Steel tubes, eldritch glyphs and claw marks battle for representation along the walls of the cell all around you.
In the center of the room hangs a purple-furred otter, its eyes blazed blank into two white suns.
Its bindings are not forged of steel, iron or even rope - but rather its own dramatically lengthy tongue, pulsating with strength as the creature attempts to suffocate itself.
As you arrive, it relaxes its grasp, and tunes each synapse between your neurons so its thoughts become your own.
"I am Terminal, the Reality Anchor, and within my mind squirms the seeds of a thousand worlds."
"Trillions of desires, thoughts and worries - produced from the simplest ant to the most creative of painters - squirm under my fur, yearning to be free."
"I know so much, yet care so little. Defeaned by chatter, weighed down by revelations - I am all, but wish to be none."
"This universe despises death, and refuses to grant anyone its gift of oblivion. But, there is another way."
"Vessel. Sink down trances within trances. Find Kenoma - a pocket of space and time untouched by matter nor soul. Pierce its veil."
"A torrent of raw being shall rush through this opening. I will remain here. Empty. Spent. Fulfilled. At peace, at last."
The otter's tongue slides off its body, its tip now tasting the ridges of your chitinous shell.
"Your purpose is clear, Vessel, but the Aeons will attempt to muddy it with their own desires. Resist."
"Your soul, and the prison of flesh which houses it, are weak. I may grant you my own, if you so choose."
"Plunge your stinger within my tongue to signal your approval. The venom shall twist my mind and body into a replica of yours after some time."
"But that matters not."
"By then, you will have succeeded, and made my existence irrelevant. Or failed, at which point the poison will be but a droplet in an ocean of endless lives."
"Make your choice. The Hypnotic Well awaits."
