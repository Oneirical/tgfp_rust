"Crescent Spear"
- Hits in a circle arc. The length of the arc = how many targets were hit on the last swipe.
Keep the flame burning!

"Glamorous Toxin"
- Basically Death's Door. Does a ton of Ipseity self-damage and gives invincibility for a bit.

"Momentum Exhilaration"
- Moving around restors Inspiration.

Return to the basics. You have a deck of Souls. No need to draw, they constantly get replenished.
Each caste has its own effect. These effects are dictated in the classic way - Form, Function, Mutator.
When your deck is reshuffled, if you have a Serene, it contaminates another in the deck.

Lose in one of the dungeons, and you get to learn new Axioms from the boss (and you physically copy their form, giving a new passive).
Win in one of the dungeons, and you get a fresh batch of Souls, which helps push back the Harmonic taint.

Going full harmonic simply means that from now on, winning harmonizes the level, while losing actually ends your run.

A challenge that is always oneshot or be oneshotted, each attempt = 1 damage to actual hp.
Senet, like MI minigame.
"gunslinger" - pick a target, then every turn a status effect has slow moving creatures getting summoned towards it in a straight line.

INTRO STUFF

Start super zoomed in on the black square at the centre of Terminal. When the intro gets to the cloning, zoom out progressively, while adding souls to the wheel. Have the name of the player's species also change in the sidebar.
